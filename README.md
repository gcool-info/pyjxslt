# pyjxslt

A Java gateway for doing XSLT 2.0 Transforms from Python.

## Introduction

Python still doesn't support [XSLT 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/). This package exists as a work-around, by allowing transformations to be done
using the latest Saxon transformation engine. It also carries built in support for the [Object Management Group (OMG)'s](http://www.omg.org/) [XML to JSON conversion standard](http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ad/13-09-04)

This package takes advantage of the [py4j](http://py4j.sourceforge.net/ Python to Java)
library and uses the [Saxon Transformation Engine](http://saxon.sourceforge.net/).

## Dependencies

This package requires the presence of Java runtime. It is currently compiled to work with version 1.7.

## Installation

**Using pypi**

    > pip install pyjxslt

**Installing from git**

    > git clone https://github.com/CTS2/pyjxslt.git
    > cd pyjxslt/pyjxslt-python
    > python setup.py install

## Use

Once installed, you need to start up the `pyjxslt` server.

    > pyjxslt [port number] [address number]
    Gateway Server Started on [port] and address [address]

Note that default values are for `port`: `25333` and for `address`: `127.0.0.1`.

Operation can be tested by:

    testgateway
    Starting Java gateway on port: 25333
    	Testing add and process transformation...Starting Java gateway on port: 25333
    success!
    Testing XML to JSON transform...success!

## Using pyjxslt as an XSLT transformer

    import pyjxslt

    gw = pyjxslt.Gateway([port #], [address #])
    # Add an xslt transformation.
    #       First parameter is the name of the transformation
    # 	    Second parameter is either XSLT text or the name of a file that contains XSLT text
    gw.add_transform('k1', xslt_text)
    # Do a transformation
    #       First parameter is the name of the xslt transformation (cached on server)
    #       Second parameter is either XML text or the name of a file that contains XML text
    #       Third parameter is dictionary of parameters to pass to XSLT Transformer
    result = gw.transform('k1', xml_text, [parms_dict])
    	...
    # Remove the transformation when you are done with it or need to replace
    # it with a new one
    gw.remove_transform('k1')

## Using pyjxslt as an XML to JSON converter

    import pyjxslt

    gw = pyjxslt.Gateway([port #], [address #])
    json = gw.to_json(xml_text)
